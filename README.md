# Checkers
Basic game of checkers that my friend and I made in Java. This my first decently sized project done outside of school.
We initially had a few more classes, a player class, as well as a checkerpiece class, but we took them out, because 
we ended up integrating them into our other classes without really realizing it. This project took us a few weeks to make,
we had to teach ourselves how to use all of the different inmports, and their different methods, so that took up the bulk of
our time.

This is a player vs player game, so you can't play against the computer. You also have to enter in the piece you want to move
and then direction you want to move into the console. In the future, when I have some more time, I would like to add it so
that you can play against the computer, as well as being able to physically click on pieces to move them instead of doing
everything through the console.

Overall, I would say this was a fun first project for me and taught me a lot about Java as a language, especially the "non-
default" parts of java (JPanel, swing etc.)
